                            The word secure resonates with being safe and tension-free. Under Optima Secure plan, we provide you with the secure benefit. This health insurance plan offers additional coverage up to 100% of the base sum Insured immediately upon purchase at no extra charge. This additional amount can be utilised for any number of admissible claims. Now isn't this truly a benefit that can keep you secure.
                            Example: You have bought an Optima Secure Health Insurance plan with a health cover or sum insured of 5 lacs. In this case, your sum insured instantly gets doubled up to offer you a total health cover of 10 lacs instead of a basic 5 lacs health cover for which you paid your valuable premium. This additional amount can be utilised for any number of admissible claims. That means you can now make claims up to 10 lacs instead of 5 lacs.

                            In these pandemic times, PPE kits, gloves, masks etc., are very widely used items during hospitalization. These are considered as disposable items and included as non-medical expenses of the hospitalization bill. But, under most health insurance policies, disposable items are not covered. With Optima Secure plan, you can easily pay for 68 listed non-medical items commonly used during a hospitalisation at no extra premium. Now, in the future, you don't need to take note of disposable items used in the treatment.
